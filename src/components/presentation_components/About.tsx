                <p>I'm Max Fransson. My journey in software is driven by a genuine curiosity and a desire to see ideas
                    come to life. I value teamwork and believe in the strength of collective effort. While I'm equipped
                    with technical skills, I see my role as more than just coding. I aim to be a supportive team member,
                    contributing to a positive and innovative environment.</p>
